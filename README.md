Web editor to create dynamic full domes


Things to create:
 - Editor
    - Edit in 3D? Edit on an equidistant projection? 
 - Visualizer
    - 3D visualizer to show what dome will look like? (Sounds difficult) (three.js?)
 - Exporter
    - Export to DM control page? (Easy now, not in future)
    - Export as file for media viewer webpage (Less dynamic, needs dm integration, future proof)
 - Save/Load
    - Save as a scene? Save as a JSON? Save as a Video?
 - Viewer
    - But only if we export project as a file
